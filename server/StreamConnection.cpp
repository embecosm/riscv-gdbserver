//! If there is a catastrophic communication failure, service will be
//! terminated using sc_stop.

//! The protocol used for communication is specified in OR1KSIM_RSP_PROTOCOL.

//! @return  TRUE if the connection was established or can be retried. FALSE
//!          if the error was so serious the program must be aborted.
