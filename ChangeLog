2017-06-25  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	* targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (RUN_SAMPLE_PERIOD) Add.
        (resume) When step is CONTINUE, step for RUN_SAMPLE_PERIOD
        instructions; if timeout expired, return TIMEOUT.
        Otherwise, repeat. Default timeout if none supplied is
        zero, resulting in single-stepping.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	Partially-working implementation of Picorv32

	Reading and writing memory and registers works, as does
	single-stepping instructions. Breakpoints are not presently
	working.

        * server/GdbServer.cpp: (RISCV_PC_REGNUM) Remove, as it seems a
	bit specific to Picorv32 (it handles the PC differently to the
	rest of the register file).
        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (RISCV_PC_REGNUM) Add.
        (resume) Implement, but only single-stepping - no mutiple steps

	Implement. (readRegister, writeRegister) Fix handling of PC, which
	is a special case.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	* targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: (readRegister, writeRegister)
	(read, write) Implement.

2017-06-24  Graham Markall  <graham.markall@embecosm.com>

	Although this builds, the Picorv32 implementation is not yet
	functioning because the functions of Picorv32 are not yet
	implemented. Mostly they will be able to call into the
	Picorv32Impl class, but some of the functions will need a little
	more work.

	class should be very similar to the original Cpu class
	implementation, and the Picorv32 class adapts it and implements
	the ITarget interface.

	Some of the choices made here are not completely future-proof;
	when we add a second core (RI5CY) we may have problems with
	linking.

        * Makefile.in: Regenerate.
        * server/Makefile.am: Link with Verilated Picorv32 libraries.
        * server/Makefile.in: Regenerate.
        * targets/picorv32/Makefile.am: Compile Picorv32.cpp and
	Picorv32Impl.cpp. Include target, target/common, and verilated

        * targets/picorv32/Picorv32.cpp: Replace old Cpu implementation

2017-06-07  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	Infrastructure for an abstracted target interface class, ITarget.
	All targets should implement the interface class ITarget, declared
	in the "targets" subdirectory.  Each target should be in its own
	subdirectory of the "targets" directory.  There is also a "common"
	subdirectory for code common to all targets.

	The result is the libtargets library, which can be linked into the
	server code, which can instantiate the target of choice.  The
	current framework has placeholders for the PicoRV32 and RI5CY
	verilator models.

	Add in the autotools generated files.  I know that there is a
	debate about whether to do this.  But we'll follow the GNU tool
	chain practice of doing so.  It means you can clone and build out
	of the box.

2017-05-25  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Handle monitor reset, and make vKill
	behave in the same way (delete cpu and construct another).

2017-05-21  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Handle vKill packet, so that server
	is terminated when GDB session quits.
	* server/RspConnection.cpp: Don't output to stdout unless
	GDBSERVER_DEBUG is defined.

2017-05-20  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* README.md: Mention building outside source tree and also
	expand example GDB session to cover breakpoints.

2017-05-20  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* README.md: Update status to mention breakpoints working.
	* server/Cpu.cpp: Add clearTrapAndRestartInstruction to properly
	continue after a breakpoint has caused a trap.
	* server/Cpu.h: New clearTrapAndRestartInstruction function.
	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Make single instruction stepping call
	clearTrapAndRestartInstruction before doing the step.

2017-05-20  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* configure.ac: Define and use VTESTBENCH variable.
	* README.md: Updated build instructions.
	* server/Makefile.am: No longer hardcode object locations.

2017-05-16  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Debug only shown when GDBSERVER_DEBUG defined.

2017-05-16  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* README.md: Updated the GDB example session section.
	* server/Cpu.cpp: Bring step function in line with what GDB expects, to
	execute a single instruction rather than just one clock step.
	* server/Cpu.h: Add clock_step function.

2017-05-16  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* README.md: Added example GDB session instructions.

2017-05-16  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/Cpu.cpp: Write PC for each step while in reset, so that it is set
	in the model once out of reset.
	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Print out when we are writing PC and then read the
	value back to confirm it was written.
	* server/main.cpp: Cycling during reset has been deferred until we attempt
	to write PC.

2017-05-15  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/Cpu.cpp: Detect inReset and trap situations and return bool from step.
	* server/Cpu.h: Add inReset and haveTrap, and return bool from step.
	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Handle 32-bit breakpoint instructions correctly.
	* server/GdbServer.h: Correct BREAK_INSTR to EBREAK instruction pattern.
	* server/MpHash.cpp: Correct instructions to be 32-bits.
	* server/MpHash.h: Likewise.
	* server/main.cpp: Cycle until CPU no longer in reset. Remove redundant command line arguments.

2017-05-15  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/Cpu.cpp: Fix spelling mistake in comment.
	* server/Cpu.h: Likewise.
	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Likewise.

	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Continue should step without reporting exception.

2017-05-15  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>

	* server/GdbServer.cpp: Corrected RISCV_PC_REGNUM to be 32.

2017-05-15  Ian Bolton  <ian.bolton@embecosm.com>
